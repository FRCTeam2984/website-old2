        <p>This was our rookie year and thusly wasn’t a great year for us in terms of winning. But a few years later the people who were on the team would win the Regionals at Las Vegas.</p>
<h1 id="our-plan">Our Plan</h1>
<p>We don’t have a viewable video of our robot but our robot was just a chassis that pulled along the trailers which human players could throw the ‘moon rocks’ into. We didn’t have any mechanism to pick up moon rocks from the ground but we had a decent driver.</p>
<h1 id="our-shortcomings">Our Shortcomings</h1>
<p>Our team didn’t have a mechanism to pick up moon rocks from the ground limiting our team immensely. We had to rely heavily on human players throwing balls accurately…we had to rely on Robotics people to do the sports thing.</p>
<p>All in all this was our first year as a team and at least we didn’t get last…</p>
