        <p>Sooooo…I never thought we would have a day that consisted of less people than last year. But I guess finals are more of a priority than Robotics who knew?</p>
<p>Bad news was we had 6 people at the start of the meeting(1 less than last year)</p>
<p>Good news is that we now have 8 people at the meeting (1 person more!)</p>
<p>Electrical is down to its Oxygen, Max. Hes focusing on making a way for 2 motors to be controlled independently and portably. He’s also planning to finish making all the movements in autonomous, from the starting position to the switch and then to the scale.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: At the end of Jaguar calibration you must set the control signal to 3 seconds.</p>

<p>So Mechanical is on the last day of prototyping anything that isn’t prototyped now will not be considered when creating mechanisms.</p>
<p>Mechanical has split into Group Experience and Group PowerHeads. Experience is working on creating several iterations of the Prototype intake Fixed. This is unlike the previous ones because it has a rigid intake that will theoretically hold the cube like a new born baby, carefully and tightly. PowerHeads are working on a way to test how to score onto the scale. POWERHEADS!!</p>
<p>This is a video of Prototype Fixed at normal speed. This design is unlike the other two intake prototypes because it has no actuation. Fixed is able to get cubes at an angle. In the video you can see that we are trying to find the angle we need to come at to acquire the cube.</p>

<p>This is a sloooooow motion top down view of the acquisition.</p>

<p>Through these tests Mechanical has come to the conclusion that the longer they make the arms the more consistent acquisition is. Today they ended up with 100% acquisition when the arms are 9.5 inches long. This length works with the cube at any position (i.e. face on or tilted)</p>
<p>Communications is continuting to redirect pages from old websites to this website!</p>
<p>Drive team is making sure they know what skills they need by the end of the season. They will know what their roles are and what their strategy is in the next three weeks. The last week will be dedicated to perfecting what they already have.</p>

<p>Logistics is working on putting receipts through Waveapp to keep our purchases up to date.</p>
<p>The Quote of the Day is “OMG that’s the coolest way to hold that”</p>
