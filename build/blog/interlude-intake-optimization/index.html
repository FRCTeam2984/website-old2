        <p>The team has spent some time optimizing a simple intake built from three 2x2 wood sections, two AndyMark Redline motors mounted to 20:1 57 Sport gearboxes, and two four-inch compliant wheels (Green 35A durometer or Blue 50A durometer).</p>
<p><img src="/images/20180203/design-of-intake.png" alt="Design of Intake"></p>
<p>Five main parameters were adjusted:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Back Width.</strong> Controls the space between the intake wheels and intake width.</li>
<li><strong>Arm Length.</strong> Determines the length of the channel and ability of the cube to straighten when edge-fed.</li>
<li><strong>Wheel Type.</strong> Applies friction early in intake process, and compresses the cube after accepted.</li>
<li><strong>Height of Intake Wheels.</strong> Should be as high as possible to allow easy over-the-back delivery of cube to scale.</li>
<li><strong>Wheel Rotational Speed.</strong> Slower speeds might lead to more controlled intake, but this parameter wasn’t varied much.</li>
</ul>
<p>The study consisted of mounting the intake to the front of an AndyMark COTS chassis. The top of the intake wheels was about 6 inches from the ground. Full power was applied to the intake motors and the chassis was driven forward. Both chassis and cube (with cover) were placed on a well-worn carpet. Three feeding situations were used: face; edge, and tilted (between face and edge). Scores are reported as the fraction of five intakes that completed face-on.</p>

<p>Best results were obtained with a 20 1/2 inch base and 9 1/2 inch arms. Blue or green wheels performed equivalently.</p>
<p>Narrow intakes were more prone to damage by edge-fed cubes. This is understandable given that the edge-fed configuration is about two inches wider than the face-fed configuration.</p>
<p>Intakes mounted with the top of wheels against the top of the cube misfed in edge-feed situations. The cube tilted forward, rather than being drawn in parallel to the ground.</p>
<p>Intakes mounted with wheels three inches from the top of the cube could ingest, but not eject a cube. Intake wheels lost traction after becoming lodged within the cutout forming the handle of the milk crate. As a result, any intake system based on this design must be mounted with the top of the intake wheels no higher than 7 1/2 inches from the ground.</p>
