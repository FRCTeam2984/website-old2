        <p>Sorry I’ve been gone the past couple days but finals have been crazy! You wouldn’t believe how hard they were. But now we can get back to Robotics.</p>
<p>Electronics is still working on making things spin to a certain amount of degrees and planning routes to increase efficiency during autonomous. They are also just laughing and having a good time now that the Electrons are back. Now communications are sitting next to them so thats not a good influence on both teams.</p>
<p>Mechanical is testing for a scale mechanism to be able to lift up the box and put it on the scales and switches, using a swing arc motion to grab the box and scoop it up and semi-throw it back onto the scale. its pretty cool but I’m not allowed to think because I’m just the lowly blog writer (Tanvir here. Marshall is a pretty cool guy and not that lowly).</p>

<p>Communications is just stylizing the website and still making the archive of all our robots. Also eating the chips and candy, it’s pretty good.</p>
<p>Drive Team is driving and getting familiar with how the robot maneuvers, spins, grabs, turns, and delivers to the exchange.</p>

<p>Logistics is trying to organize the files from Google Drive, so that we can move them onto the website. He is also working on finding what sponsors have sponsored us in the past.</p>
<p>The Quote for today is “I used to be on Mechanical like you, then I took a Robot to the shin”</p>
<p>Goodbye, I love you.</p>
<p>Mood: German</p>
