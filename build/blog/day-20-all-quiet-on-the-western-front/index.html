        <p>The true King has returned my friends. Marshall the tyrant has become ill with the plague and is now stuck at home leaving me to right the wrongs that have been done in my absence.</p>
<p>Logistics is continuing to organize sponsors in the effort that they may once again help our kingdom thrive and win the competition in March. This is Day 20 a momentous occasion for us that are left. This is about half way through the build season.</p>

<p>Mechanical is spreading their power over the Kingdom. One group(Fixers) is optimizing intakes before they fully implement the Fixed Intake. Another group(Scalers) is testing if the Scale mechanism is worthy of being on our holy robot. They have about 5 days including today to finish creating mechanisms leaving us about two weeks to test the mechanisms.</p>
<p>Here you can see the mechanism for the scale in action.</p>

<p>Communications is down to the King now my peasants and the traitor have headed for home. I will have finished all the archives of past years. There will also be videos showing what we did today.</p>
<p>Electrical is creating a subsystem to control the motors on the arm allowing for intake and release. They are also creating a system to get feedback through LEDs. As for intake they are trying to find what angles they need to approach the cube to succeed in getting it as well as a system for intake.</p>
