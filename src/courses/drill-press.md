In this lesson we will be covering just how to use the Drill Press. From drilling clearance holes to drilling holes for fun, you can expect to be using this delightful piece of machinery throughout most of the season! There will be a video tutorial at the bottom of each of when the lessons are done.

This is what the video should have:

- 1 How to turn on/off the Drill Press
- 2 How to operate the Drill Press(How to push down properly)
- 3 How to properly secure objects being drilled
- 4 What objects not to drill
- 5 How to tell which drill bit is which
