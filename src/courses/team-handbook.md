Team Handbook
The job of this handbook is to explain to you member, team lead even mentor how our team works and how to run our team. These are guidelines created from the team members from past years so these are tested.

Team Meetings-
At meetings your start time can differ but make sure people know when to show up before the day of the meeting.  
When you start have a team update that follows this order:  
1 - See if anybody has an announcement i.e. A t-shirt order or a important meeting date  
2 - See if there is any new rules that FRC has made a ruling on  
3 - Check if specifically Team leads need to announce anything  
4 - Start  
When you split up have each team lead have a little update with their team so everybody knows what they are doing. People who come late can be notified of what they can do but the more time you spend catching them up the less time you are doing something productive.  
The meeting should continue to flow with the teams asking for help when they need but otherwise working independently.  
At the end of the meeting have another team update that should follow accordingly:  
1 - See what each team has done for this meeting  
2 - Make sure each team says 1 bad thing that happened today


Requirement to be a Team Lead-
A possible Team Lead should have the following qualities
1 - Attendance -Above 80% attendance rate
2 - Experience - At least 1 year of experience with the team
3 - Legacy - Previous Team Lead believes the person to be an acceptable replacement
4 - Reliability - Has completed important tasks before to the best of their ability

Attendance Policy-
If a person does not notify a team lead before the day of absence they are considered as an unexcused absence, if they do notify a team lead they can be marked as an excused absence. If they are at the meeting but do not sign the sign-in sheet they are considered as an unexcused absence. A person who has more than 25% of the total meeting days marked as an unexcused absence is not considered part of the team. They can have as many excused absences but cannot hold any important responsibilities if they drop below 80% attendance rate.

PDA and relationships-
For the sake of the team all relationships are to be kept at the door. Beef between students doesn't need to happen in a room that's smaller than most of the bathrooms in our school. There shouldn't be any kissing at Robotics, nobody wants to see that, other forms of PDA should not interfere with robotics work.
