# Our Plan

Like many robots we created a robot to do the one task presented throw basketballs into hoops. Our robot could pick up basketballs from the ground and launch them at variable heights.

That is where we went wrong, the amount of chance that went into launching a basketball meant that we didn't get a consistent amount of points if any at all.

# Our Shortcomings

Our inconsistent amount of points meant that we had to rely on our teammates which is never a good strategy.
