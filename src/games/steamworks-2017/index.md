# Our Plan

Our focus that year was to make a robot that could easily get gears and deliver them to aircraft. We were able to load gears almost perfectly but in our attempts to get the gear up to the pilot we rarely were able to succeed.

Sadly that year didn't go too well. We ended up last at the San Diego Regional, but we learned a lot for years to come.

# Our Shortcomings

More practice. The driver needed to get to a point that he could retrieve the gears in record time and the pilot needed to be adept in quickly lifting the gears up without losing them.
