For many high schoolers Martin Luther King Day means a three-day weekend to kick and relax. For the students in Robotics it means another 8 hour day at school...*half-hearted* Robotics!

Today was a turning point for the ages.

Watch your shins! Electrical furthered autonomous to a point that it can start in the center position and reach the switch. They also worked on this year's robot in the end making a drivable chassis.

Watch the video below to see our autonomous! (It's onnnnnly code)

Mechanical started on their prototypes to pick up powercube. Their ideas range from using foam noodles to even wheels to pick up the powercube. They even came up with some great pick-up lines such as "Hey baby are you duct tape cuz you and I stick together" and "Are you an angle cuz I spent so long making you perfect".

Logistics can now correctly see our current funds.

Communications updated the blogs with pictures.

The mood is generally good.
