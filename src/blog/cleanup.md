We are getting excited to be the best we can this season!

This week was the first of two clean-up meetings. Our four teams:
Logistics, Communications, Mechanical and Electrical cleaned up materials they will most likely use during the season.

Mechanical disassembled past yearâ€™s robots as well as cleaned up machining stations.

Software organized their electrical equipment and their Github accounts.

Communications organized the website you are seeing this on while Logistics worked on making the team t-shirts.
