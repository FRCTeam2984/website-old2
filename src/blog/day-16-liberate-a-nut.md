Today we go back to our roots with all teams having one person each...

Today is also the second to last day until we end prototypes. Tick tock, tick tock.

Mechanical eliminated their intake prototypes and began to start lifting prototypes. Tick tock, tick tock.

In this video you can see that the Independent Arms prototype cannot hold cubes and also move even if the arms are held rigid. Tick, tock, tick tock.

In this video you can see that the tension created by the surgical tube tightening around the arms makes it harder for the cube to be delivered. Tick tock, tick tock.

The mood is Castaway.
