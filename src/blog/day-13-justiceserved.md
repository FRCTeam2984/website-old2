A criminal meets sweet justice as he walked into this robotics meeting today, to face his fate and the punishment for theft of goods. It is a beautiful day and in addition to the glorious sentence we have today made history as this is when the real work starts. Unite! Brothers and sisters! Today is the day the work gets started.

Mechanical is working on mounting mechanisms for the intake machines on the robot and also working on making the intake machines better for the robot. More specifically they are seeing if they can get lever arms or static arms  for the mounting mechanisms. This is becoming a larger task than I realized.


Communications is undertaking the large task of redesigning the website, like total redesign, mostly colors and text, but Niki is handling it like a champ. The team is also making an archive to showcase all the old robots up to 2015. Lukas is fixing logos so they are presentable. And Warren is designing a slideshow for the website. Logistics is still just filling and finding disturbances.

Electronics is making the robot do things, such as fixing overshoot, adding protection to overshoot, making it so it finishes straight instead of crooked and making it so it can rapidly rotate because thats necessary for some reason. but at least it looks cool

The mood today is justice
