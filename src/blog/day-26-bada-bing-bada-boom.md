MARSHALL HE CAME BACK!!! And then he had to leave...There was a bit of a problem with his Github repositories so he didn't get to do a lot but I'm sure he will get more today.


He came in looking like this which is a pretty cool way to return to Robotics.

So Mechanical is still a bit a bottleneck for the Drive team but never fear we will get the Drive Team practice it deserves.

Mechanical has again split into two teams. The first is trying to finalize any plans for mechanisms on the robot including the intake and the skyhook.

Onshape in progress...please wait until fully loaded...

The other group is creating mounting systems and a wooden mock-up of the redesigned intake as to help Drive Team get some practice in.

Again Electrical has the most consistent attendance and has the fewest jobs to do. Today they updated the Roborio firmware and imaging to make our robot up to date in the software department. They have also finished the cable management on the robot.

Now they just hang out eat goldfish and play minesweeper.
