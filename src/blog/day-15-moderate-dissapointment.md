Dear Diary,
Today while i was walking i noticed the groups hard at work and I just have to laugh because I am so grateful to be part of this merry team!

For example, Mechanical is busy working on lifting Mechanism instead of just a grabbing mechanism so thats pretty cool. the puddle they sit next to is slowly evaporating and its almost gone so that'll be a major update, I'll keep you notified.

Electronics is busy fixing current motor intakes so the motor doesn't burn out. They're also seeing the variable of a starting point to see if they start it at a different place if it can end where they want it, and still making it end straight.

Communications is making a logo for a team pin and it doesn't look that great but we'll fix that up with some troubleshooting. The author is also helping make a team manual for instructions in the future, like a written safety video with less bad acting.

Logistics is still fixing gaps, (It's a one man team so were going slow)
